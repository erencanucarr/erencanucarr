# Hi, I'm Eren Can 👋  

🎯 **System Technical Support Specialist** | 💻 **IT Enthusiast** | 🛠️ **Open Source Advocate**

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Eren Can, a 22-year-old IT professional passionate about systems, support, and open source technologies. I'm currently working as a **System Technical Support Specialist** at **NiobeHosting** (since February 2024) and **FastPanda Limited** (since August 2024).  

I actively follow the latest developments in the tech world and constantly strive to learn, evolve, and share what I know. I enjoy blending the knowledge I gain from experience and research, and I publish insights and tutorials on my personal website.

🔓 I’m a big fan of **Open Source** – not just using it, but contributing to it as well. You’ll often find me building and sharing open source tools and systems that help others in the community.
